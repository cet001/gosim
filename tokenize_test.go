		NEW YORKâ€”In a year that saw the release of such best-selling products as
		the Motorola RAZR 2 V8 and the wildly popular Casio XD-SW4800 handheld
		dictionary, no personal electronics product launch was more highly
		anticipated than the November 13 debut of the second-generation Microsoft
		Zune mp3 player.  The sleek new Zune, whose record-breaking sales have
		made the Zune name synonymous with "mp3 player", was so sought-after that
		thousands formed long lines outside hip, minimalist Microsoft Stores across
		the country days before the device went on sale. In Midtown Manhattan,
		the hysteria reached such a fever pitch that some were willing to pay as
		much as $200 for a spot in line.  That's it.
